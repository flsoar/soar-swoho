## About  Soar-swoho

Ultra-lightweight serverless framework to quickly build micro-service monomers.

Starting a new project is a very troublesome thing, not only the development program itself, but also the configuration of the running environment. I have developed golang applications, and the developed programs can run by themselves. I am attracted by this convenience. With the help of openswool, soar-swoho was born.
